# AI_Search_Optimization_Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to experience in solving search and optimization problems, as well as understanding the underlying techniques.

## Question 1 – Problem Solving via Search 
### a) Framing a Problem 
- **Jumping Frogs**: Formulate the problem of moving frogs between rocks using the provided search interface.
- **Route Planning**: Implement a program to find the shortest path between cities based on provided CSV files.

### b) Solving a Search Problem 
Develop a search agent using the A* algorithm to find solutions to the problems formulated in part (a).

### c) Knowing A* 
i. Understand the importance of having an admissible heuristic in A* for optimality.
ii. Describe the requirement of monotonicity in A*.

## Question 2 – Optimization 
### a) Simulated Annealing 
Implement the Simulated Annealing algorithm to find global maximum/minimum of various functions provided.

### b) Plotting Graphs 
Visualize the execution of the Simulated Annealing algorithm by plotting graphs of x, y, and the function value over iterations.
